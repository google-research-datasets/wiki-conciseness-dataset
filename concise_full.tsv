Given that the magnets are a dominant factor in reactor design, and that density and temperature combine to produce pressure, the ratio of the pressure of the plasma to the magnetic energy density naturally becomes a useful figure of merit when comparing MCF designs.	Magnets are a dominant factor in reactor design, and density and temperature combine to produce pressure, so, ratio of the plasma pressure to the magnetic energy density naturally becomes a useful figure of merit when comparing MCF designs.	With magnets being a dominant factor in reactor design and density and temperature combined to produce pressure, the pressure of the plasma to the magnetic energy density becomes a figure of merit when comparing MCF designs.	Because magnets are dominant in reactor design, and that density and temperature combine to produce pressure, the ratio of the plasma pressure to the magnetic energy density naturally becomes a useful figure of merit when comparing MCF designs.	Since the magnets’ importance dominates in reactor design, and because density and temperature produce pressure, the ratio of the plasma pressure to the magnetic energy density naturally becomes a meritorious figure when comparing MCF designs.
